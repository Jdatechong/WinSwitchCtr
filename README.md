# WinSwitchCtr

WinSwitchCtr is a simple Python script to record and visualize window switches on Windows devices.
Window switches are received using a hook from pywin32, data is stored in a Pandas dataframe, and the data is visualized using Matplotlib.


## Windows Installation

Go to releases and download and extract the latest version. Then, run the 'WinSwitchCtr' executable.

Alternatively, you can download the repo and run it for yourself.

## Mac version
Mac version is TBA until I find a way to detect window switches.

## Important upcoming changes

 - [ ] Save and load old data
 - [ ] Add more graph visualization settings
